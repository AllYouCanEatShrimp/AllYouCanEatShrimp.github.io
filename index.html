                 <p>
                    Our users tend to get tired of constantly digging to find music that fits their needs and are in search of quality music that accurately reflects how they feel. Our solution is to get away from the mainstream music applications such as YouTube, Spotify and Apple Music, and provide a way for users to effortlessly sift through the musical underground.
